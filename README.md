## Spring profiles

In `boot.sh` you can choose one of available profiles:
- `prod` - setting up services with admin profile
- `test_data` - the same as `prod` but with pre-created data

## Deploy

We need the jar file of the application. It could be done with `gradle build`.  
After put with `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `boot.sh` in the same directory.  
Then we can start docker containers with `docker-compose up --build`.
